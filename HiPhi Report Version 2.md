# Introduction #

Video Games form a rapidly growing industry moving towards an artistic form that both programmers and players can appreciate ([Wexler, 2002](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~brown/242/assts/termprojs/games.pdf)). The term "Game AI" encompasses programming and design practices, including path-finding algorithms, neural-networks, models of interaction, state machines, and decision trees, all with the common goal of providing some intelligent behaviour ([Mateas, 2003](http://lmc.gatech.edu/~mateas/publications/MateasDIGRA2003.pdf)). Game AI aims to establish the belief in a living entity within the computer that can act independently of the player.

## The Founding Fathers ##

Game AI shares its foundations with the rise of digital processing. Claude Shannon and Alan Turing started developing chess programs as early as 1950. Board games were the popular choice for experimenting with Artificial Intelligence due to their nature of perfect information - the entire state of the game can be captured by the computer. They are typically non-trivial search problems with no well-defined path to a given solution as the involvement of an opponent introduces a degree of uncertainty ([Middleton, 2002](http://web.stanford.edu/group/htgg/sts145papers/zmiddleton_2002_1.pdf)).

## The Early Years ##

During the early years of video games, AI was not a feature due to the simplicity of the games produced, and human centred design.

In 1949, Claude Shannon published the paper *Programming a Computer for Playing Chess* in which he describes how a machine can decide how to move such that it can minimise the possible loss in the worst case scenario ([Shannon, 1949](http://www.pi.infn.it/~carosi/chess/shannon.txt)). His reasons for using chess as the basis for his paper include:
    * The legal move-set and the end goal is well defined
    * It is neither a trivial problem, nor too difficult to calculate a viable solution
    * There is a element of skilful thinking involved
    * The discrete structure of chess fits well into the design of computers

A computerised version of Nim was published in 1952, and was able to consistently win games against players 95% of the time ([The New Yorker, 1952](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1952/08/02/it))

# The 90's Explosion #

As the arcade and video game industry began to wane in the late 80's, gamers began to crave a better quality of gameplay. The goal of the industry then was to create a more challenging and lifelike opponent, which would react to the player like a human.

# Current Research Topics #

The primary goal of Game AI is to entertain. As such, developers tend to avoid using true "academic" AI, opting for short-cuts and efficiency, whilst maintaining some level of intelligence in the system.

Researchers have redefined the role of artificial intelligence in video games by replacing all human interaction with intelligent agents.
