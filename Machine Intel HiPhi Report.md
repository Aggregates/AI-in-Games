# Abstract #

The evolution of artificial intelligence(AI) in gaming has its origins in the earliest conversions of popular board games from physical to digital formats. From the early 1950â€™s when Claude and Shannon designed AI for the first Chess games and Arthur Samuel created a self-playing, learning checkers program, the development and refining of intelligent agents or non-player characters(NPCs) has woven itself into the fabric of game development. This presentation will cover how AI in gaming has evolved over the past decades from basic finite state machines, path finding, and information processing when given incomplete information, as well as the innovative steps and advancements in machine learning techniques to design the AI we see today in lifelike characters with behavioural traits, and the possibilities for the future.

# Introduction #

Video Games form a rapidly growing industry moving towards an artistic form that both programmers and players can appreciate ([Wexler, 2002](http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~brown/242/assts/termprojs/games.pdf)). The term "Game AI" encompasses programming and design practices, including path-finding algorithms, neural-networks, models of interaction, state machines, and decision trees, all with the common goal of providing some intelligent behaviour ([Mateas, 2003](http://lmc.gatech.edu/~mateas/publications/MateasDIGRA2003.pdf)). Game AI aims to establish the belief in a living entity within the computer that can act independently of the player.
